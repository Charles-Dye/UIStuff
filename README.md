This plugin for TCC adds a few miscellaneous user-interface features.  You can
get or set the screen resolution for any monitor, the wallpaper image and style,
the desktop background color, the screen saver settings, and the master sound
volume and mute state.  You can create, modify, display, or parse shortcut
files.  You can display or set file associations and shell verbs.

This plugin might be useful for setting user defaults in a logon script,
customizing freshly-imaged computers, or to temporarily change settings while
running some particularly fussy program.

Windows XP or later is required.
